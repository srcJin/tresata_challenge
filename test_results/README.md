# Test Results

This directory contains batch test results from the Magic Mirror agent.

## File Format

Results are saved as JSON files with the naming convention:
```
{agent_name}_{timestamp}.json
```

Example: `magic_mirror_20251004_143025.json`

## JSON Structure

```json
{
  "agent": "magic_mirror",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T14:30:25.123456",
  "test_count": 10,
  "conversations": [
    {
      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "Who is the fairest of them all?",
      "response": "Mirror, mirror, shining bright...",
      "error": null,
      "timestamp": "2025-10-04T14:30:26.789012"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Custom Questions

You can create your own test questions file (one question per line):

**sample_questions.txt**
```
Who is the fairest of them all?
What do you see in your reflection?
Tell me about the future
```

Then run:
```bash
./4_test_batch.sh test_results/sample_questions.txt
```

## Usage

**Run default batch test:**
```bash
./4_test_batch.sh
```

**Run with custom questions:**
```bash
./4_test_batch.sh test_results/sample_questions.txt
```

## Viewing Results

Results can be viewed directly or parsed with any JSON tool:

```bash
# Pretty print latest result
cat test_results/magic_mirror_*.json | jq '.'

# Extract all questions
cat test_results/magic_mirror_*.json | jq '.conversations[].question'

# Extract all responses
